Rename and restructure project as OpTrack (Opportunity Tracker)

This commit represents a major refactoring of the project:

1. Renamed the project from "scrape-websites" to "OpTrack" to better reflect its purpose
2. Completely reorganized the codebase into a clean, modular structure:
   - core/ - Core tracking functionality
   - scripts/ - Automation scripts
   - utils/ - Utility functions
   - tests/ - Test infrastructure
   - data/ - Storage for cookies and other data
   - output/ - Output directory for generated files
3. Removed redundant and development files from the root directory

4. Enhanced grant tracking functionality:
   - Added multi-source support with source identifiers
   - Created a unified database for all sources
   - Implemented export capabilities for data analysis
   - Added automated cron job configuration

5. Improved documentation:
   - Updated README with new structure and capabilities
   - Added CHANGELOG for version tracking
   - Included examples for common use cases

This restructuring makes the codebase more maintainable, improves clarity of purpose, and sets the foundation for future additions of more grant sources.
